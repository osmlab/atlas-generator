An example of each mode (print, details, interactive) is included below. Note that the mode is
supplied as a regular argument.

Print mode: print basic info for DMA from a DMA-AIA-CYM configuration, given a local config file:
#$ config-info --countries DMA,AIA,CYM --config-resource /Users/foo/config.json print DMA
Details mode: Assuming <WORLD> is a comma separated list of world countries, print details containing the both strings
"ATA" and "9" (e.g. to show ATA level 9) for a web-based configuration:
#$ config-info --countries <WORLD> --config-resource "https://www.config.com/config.json" details ATA 9
Interactive mode: assuming <JSON> is a string of configuration JSON, launch an interactive explorer shell for a DMA configuration
#$ config-info --countries DMA --config-json <JSON> interactive
